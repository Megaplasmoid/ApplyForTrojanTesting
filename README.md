# ApplyForTrojanTesting
Having a Trojan to test? We've got you covered with the using of a VirtualMachine! By Applying here, you would agree to the EULA of this Repository (Please Read Carefully):

Trojans can be a fun way to create, but it can be risky if it gets into the wrong hands. By applying here, there are a few things to know. "Worm" means a malicious software that every
victim it makes, it spreads to more victims on the contact list. "Cryptojacking" means damage to physical hardware via either overheating the CPU, Overclocking the GPU, or any damage necessary to the device. "Submitter" means the one who submits a Trojan (in this case, it is the user who submits a Trojan to test on). "Trojan" means the type of malicious software
in disguise as a legitimate software, but then takes control over when people fall for it. "OS" means the Operating System software that the Trojan is going to be tested on. "Prohibited" means the ones that are not allowed in the Testing Level.

1. Operating System:
  Within the OS, the safety measures are to take place. The Operating System would be As-Is (In other words, not going to get any updates), and to understand that it is better As-Is, so that there will be no payment involved for losing it. The OS is also used via OracleVM VirtualBox, so that the Main Machine will be safe, and so that it won't take any damages.

2. Safety Measures:
The Virtual can still be useful for Trojans, but not for Worms. In this case, there will be safety measures to take place (Check 2.1.x for the ones Prohibited).

2.1. The ones Prohibited for the test:
The obvious reasons are either that it can spread via a hacktool, or a worm activity. The safety measures are here for certain reasons.

2.1.1. Worms are Prohibited:
Worms are a very dangerous Malicious software, not only because of the damage it can take, but also the way it spreads from one device to another as it is Programmed to do. This is the reason why Worms are not Permitted in this environment. It can deal a lot of damage, and there are multiple people using the Modem. For in this case, Worms are not allowed at all.

2.1.2. Ransomwares are Prohibited:
Ransomwares are not part of a Trojan, it is part of a Ransom Attack. We will still stick to Trojans As-Is and won't like it when our minds are changed.

2.1.3. False Tattle Tales:
This is one of the strict ones. Anyone who Tattle Tales will also have their Trojan being denied As-Is.

2.1.4. Scamming, Spamming, Fraud:
These are also not allowed at all. Doing so will be immediate consequence for breaking the Safety Measures.

2.2. The Consequences for breaking the Safety Measures:
If you break 2.1.x, your Malware applyment will be denied and you will not get it tested. This also includes that you may not anymore get your Malware tested at any cost. If you persist on, then there will be heavy consequences that will lead to your way, including but not limited to, getting contacted to the Authorities, Locking you away from the Branch, Blacklisting, etc.
